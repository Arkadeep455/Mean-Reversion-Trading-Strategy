A mean-reversion trading strategy using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process involves the following
steps:
1. Identifying a Mean-Reverting Asset: Find an asset whose price exhibits mean-reverting
behavior.
2. Estimating Parameters: Estimate the parameters of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
(mean, reversion speed, and volatility) using historical price data.
3. Generating Trading Signals: Generate buy and sell signals based on the deviation of the
asset's price from its mean.
– Buy Signal: When the asset's price is significantly below the mean.
– Sell Signal: When the asset's price is significantly above the mean.
4. Risk Management: Implement stop-loss orders and position sizing to manage risk.
